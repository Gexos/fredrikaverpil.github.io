[Filmgate](http://www.filmgate.se) were offered the opportunity by Ghost A/S to work, as sub-contractors, on this exciting Zentropa production which at the time was the largest visual effects movie to be made in Scandinavia.

The work for Filmgate involved working on 457 shots out of 627 which consisted of compositing, roto, matte paintings, set extensions and various small 3D work. On this project I primarily worked with green screen keying and compositing in Nuke as well as minor 3D work in Maya.
