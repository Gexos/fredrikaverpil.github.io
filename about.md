My name is Giorgos and I am a certified computer and network technician living in Greece, I am heavily interested in various aspects of Computer and Network Security, especially in malware analysis, web application security and cryptography.

I have some experience in various programming/scripting languages such as: Python, PowerShell, AutoIt, and Web related languages like: HTML, XML, CSS, Javascript.

I have also a strong affection for Open Source, and I try to contribute to the OSS community as much as I can.

You can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/theGexos), and [github](https://github.com/Gexos).
