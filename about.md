Throughout the years I have been spending my professional life within the digital domain of creativity; from web site design/development to 3D animation and digital visual effects for feature films. With 15+ years of hands on experience within the field of computer graphics, including co-founding [Filmgate](http://www.filmgate.se), having catered to clients and coached production teams in the ad agency world as well as having developed several graphics pipelines, I now take part in the extraordinary team of talent at [Industriromantik](http://www.industriromantik.se) as a multi-disciplinary creative and Technical Director.
